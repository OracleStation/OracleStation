You find yourself a few fries short of a happy meal.
You realize you've forgotten to wear your helmet today.
Now you know why you're not allowed to sharpen the crayons.
That was absolutely fucking retarded.
You reconsider the garbage that was about to come out of your mouth.
Simply thinking about trying to say that made you just a little bit dumber.
You re-evaluate your life choices.
How many times were you dropped as a child, exactly?
You'll need a breather after coming up with that thing.
You feel like a screw is loose... but you don't have any screws, do you?
You feel as if you're a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
You feel as though you're a few cards short of a full deck.
You feel like you're a few beers short of a six-pack.
You feel like you're a few metaphors short of a mental breakdown.
You feel like your IQ just dipped below room temperature.
You feel dumber than a box of Donk pockets, and boy are those dumb.
You can't quite believe it, but it seems that your words have managed to be emptier than your head.
Those vocal cords have to have it really bad with you, don't they?
You feel like punching yourself in the face would be justified right now.
Your head aches as images of screaming frogs fill your vision for a split-second.
All you can manage is a strangled croak before you stop yourself from spouting that garbage.
It would appear the source of the problem is located between the chair and the keyboard.
